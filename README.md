Virtualis client
================

> A console client for [Virtualis] API.

[Virtualis]: http://www.service-virtualis.com/

Description
-----------

The Virtualis service is the only way provided by my bank to manage
virtual credit cards, with amount limit and custom expiration date.

While I like these features, I'm not satisfied with the few ways they
provide to access this API; a Microsoft Windows binary and an Adobe
Flash application. I'm not using both of these softwares, *mainly
because their licenses are not acceptable to me*.

That's why I reverse engineered their Flash client, to understand how
works their protocol, [document it](api.md), build a [Python
library](virtualis) and a [command-line client](virtualis-client).
